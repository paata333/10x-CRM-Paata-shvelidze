```

## Data Persistence

All data is stored in the browser's localStorage under the following keys:

- `crm_users` — Array of registered user objects
- `crm_session` — Current user's login session
- `crm_clients` — Array of client objects (persisted from API or local additions)
- `crm_theme` — User's theme preference ("light" or "dark")

## API Integration

The app fetches initial client data from the free [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com) API:

- `GET /users?limit=30` — Fetches 30 sample users
- `POST /users/add` — Mocked user creation (returns response but doesn't persist on server)
- `DELETE /users/{id}` — Mocked user deletion

All changes are persisted locally in localStorage.
